Miniflux 2
==========

Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader.
It's simple, fast, lightweight and super easy to install.

Official website: <https://miniflux.app>

This project is an opinionated fork of Miniflux.

## Changes from [upstream](https://github.com/miniflux/v2):

* Google Reader API applies user's `Entry sorting` as default sort direction.

  The upstream uses hardcoded `desc`, if a reader didn't request specific sort
  direction, like [Read You] does at this moment. And entries always returned
  ordered newest first.

  [Read You]: https://github.com/Ashinch/ReadYou

* Refactor and simplify config parser.

  Use [env](https://github.com/caarlos0/env) and
  [godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv) for parsing config and env
  variables. Validate it using
  [validator](https//github.com/go-playground/validator).

* Add `LOG_FORMAT=human`.

  It logs something like:
  ```
  2025/04/20 16:02:00 INFO Starting HTTP server listen_address=127.0.0.1:8080
  ```
  instead of
  ```
  time=2025-04-20T16:02:00.561+02:00 level=INFO msg="Starting HTTP server" listen_address=127.0.0.1:8080
  ```

* Automatically reopen log file(s) on rotation.

* Multiple log files.

  With configuration like this

  ```
  LOG_0_FILE=stderr
  LOG_0_FORMAT=human
  LOG_0_LEVEL=warning

  LOG_1_FILE=/var/log/miniflux/miniflux.log
  LOG_1_FORMAT=human
  LOG_1_DATE_TIME=true
  LOG_1_LEVEL=info
  ```

  all errors and warnings will be logged to both stderr and
  `/var/log/miniflux/miniflux.log`. Info messages will be logged to
  `miniflux.log` only.

  Any error from second logger will be logged by first logger. Errors from first
  logger are ignored.

* Refactor CLI.

  Use [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for parsing flags and args:

  ```
  $ miniflux -h
  Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader.

  Usage:
    miniflux [flags]
    miniflux [command]

  Available Commands:
    completion               Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
    config-dump              Print parsed configuration values
    create-admin             Create an admin user from an interactive terminal
    export-user-feeds        Export user feeds
    flush-sessions           Flush all sessions (disconnect users)
    healthcheck              Perform a health check on the given endpoint
    help                     Help about any command
    info                     Show build information
    migrate                  Run SQL migrations
    refresh-feeds            Refresh a batch of feeds and exit

    reset-password           Reset user password
    run-cleanup-tasks        Run cleanup tasks (delete old sessions and archives old entries)

  Flags:
    -c, --config-file string   Path to configuration file
    -d, --debug                Show debug logs
    -h, --help                 help for miniflux
    -v, --version              version for miniflux

  Use "miniflux [command] --help" for more information about a command.
  ```

* Refactor storage and switch to [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx)

  `DATABASE_URL` have additional variables for pool configuration:

  ```
  pool_max_conn_idle_time: duration string (default 30 minutes)
  pool_health_check_period: duration string (default 1 minute)
  pool_max_conn_lifetime_jitter: duration string (default 0)
  ```

  See [ParseConfig] for details.

  Don't specify `pool_max_conns`, `pool_min_conns` and `pool_max_conn_lifetime`,
  because config variables `DATABASE_MAX_CONNS`, `DATABASE_MIN_CONNS` and
  `DATABASE_CONNECTION_LIFETIME` overwrite it.

  `DATABASE_MAX_CONNS` changed its default from 20 to the greater of 4 or
  `runtime.NumCPU()`.

  [ParseConfig]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx/v5@v5.7.4/pgxpool#ParseConfig

* Optionally prefer site icon, instead of feed icon.

  New option `PREFER_SITE_ICON=true` configures `miniflux` always use
  auto-detected site icon, instead of icon found in feed description.

* Limit max number of connections per server.

  By default the maximum is 8 connections per server. This limit can be changed
  by adding `CONNECTIONS_PER_SERVER` to the config, like

  ```
  CONNECTIONS_PER_SERVER=10
  ```

  which increases the limit to 10 connections per server.

* Changed a little how article items looks like.

  Light theme:
  ![Light theme](images/light.png)

  Dark theme:
  ![Dark theme](images/dark.png)

* Republished entries marked as unread.

* Custom comments URL per feed.

  Any feed can be configured with custom comments URL instead of feed's comment
  URL via edit feed UI. The new setting expected to be a templated string like:
  `{{ .URL }}/comments/`. This example appends `/comments/` to entry URL and use
  it as comments URL of this entry. As a shortcut, if the template begins with
  `/` it directly appends to entry URL, like in previous example.

* Click on comments URL mark this entry as read.

  If mark entries as read when viewed enabled in user settings.
