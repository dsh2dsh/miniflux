🌟 DESCRIPTION🌟

Umbrella Security Service (USS) Delta team enters the Raccoon City Underground Laboratory, where they meet up with Alpha team leader HUNK. Their mission is to assist the Alpha team in stopping Dr. William Birkin from handing over his T-virus research to the U.S. military and retrieve the G-virus. On their way to Birkin's lab, they find Birkin has paid numerous Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (UBCS) private military contractors to work for him while the deal goes forward. When they reach Birkin's lab, the doctor injects himself with the virus, and HUNK stays behind to fight him while Delta team proceeds.

Not long after the battle, it becomes evident that the T-virus has leaked citywide, and people are beginning to transform into flesh-hungry zombies. In what they see as a punishment by USS command, Delta team is ordered to remove evidence of Umbrella's role in the outbreak.

Later, the team is sent out around Raccoon Park to find the Nemesis-T Type, which has gone rogue. A second parasite is injected into its body in order to bring it back under control. Shortly after this mission is completed, the team is then sent out to the Raccoon City Police Department, ordered to kill any surviving police officers and destroy evidence linking the company to the outbreak. The team exits the station, and soon after encounter Leon S. Kennedy, whom they begin to hunt down along with Sherry Birkin. After they find and corner Leon, Claire Redfield, and Sherry, the game can end in two ways: in one ending, half of the team spares Leon and betrays the other and kill them. They then resign from Umbrella over their abandonment during the mission and betray them by letting the three live; in the other, Leon and Claire are executed, and Sherry is sent to an Umbrella facility.

Spec Ops Campaign
Spec Ops Command deployed the Echo Six team into Raccoon City in order to discover the causes of the outbreak. Heading into Raccoon City Police Department, they meet with Jill Valentine, who is fleeing the Nemesis. She points Umbrella as responsible for the outbreak and advises the team to investigate the City Hall for evidence before parting. There Echo Six finds blueprints of an Umbrella underground laboratory and heads to the sewers to find its entrance, fighting Nemesis along the way.

Moving further into the sewers, Echo Six comes into contact with the mutated Birkin attacking USS soldiers, and Claire Redfield, who is searching for Sherry Birkin. The team escort Claire and find Sherry, before being ambushed by Birkin. Claire takes Sherry away through a doorway as Echo Six covers their escape; they then defeat Birkin and continue their mission.

Finding the underground lab, Echo Six learns that T-virus is the cause of the outbreak and that the G-virus could make the situation worse. They are given orders to collect a sample of the G-virus for further study. Further, into the lab, they learn that Sherry is carrying a G-virus sample, and a Tyrant is being programmed to hunt her down to retrieve it.

Spec Ops Command receives a distress call from Leon S. Kennedy, informing them of the whereabouts of Claire and Sherry; Echo Six is tasked with assisting in their evacuation. In the extraction zone, they are attacked by the Parasite Super Tyrant; Echo Six fights it and kills it. Leon, Claire, and Sherry are then evacuated on the chopper as Command tells Echo Six to stay behind for one last mission that only they can accomplish.

   <media:description>DYING LIGHT Full Movie Saga All Cutscenes (Full Game Movie) 4K 60FPS Ultra HD includes the full story, ending and final boss of the game. The game was played, recorded and edited by Gamer’s Little Playground team. We recorded the game in 4K 60FPS on Steam PC. The video also includes all cutscenes, final boss, all bosses, no commentary, all missions and all cinematics.

🌟 DESCRIPTION🌟

The Dying Light saga begins in the quarantined city of Harran, where a viral outbreak has turned the population into infected and left survivors abandoned behind military cordons. Kyle Crane, an undercover operative sent by the GRE, is tasked with recovering sensitive research while infiltrating the survivor resistance. As Crane fights alongside civilians struggling to stay alive, he becomes increasingly conflicted between his mission and the people he has come to protect. The rise of the ruthless warlord Rais exposes how human ambition and cruelty thrive alongside the infection, forcing Crane to confront the cost of loyalty, obedience, and survival as Harran collapses beyond control.

In the DLC THE FOLLOWING, Crane leaves the city in search of answers, uncovering a secluded cult in the countryside that claims to understand the true nature of the virus. Led by the enigmatic Mother, the cult reveals that the outbreak may not be an accident, nor something that can simply be cured or contained. Crane’s pursuit of the truth leads to devastating choices that determine the fate of Harran and signal the beginning of humanity’s irreversible decline.

Fifteen years later, in DYING LIGHT 2: STAY HUMAN, civilization has largely fallen. The world survives in isolated city-states, and Villedor stands as one of the last strongholds of humanity. Aiden Caldwell, a wanderer searching for his lost sister Mia, is drawn into a brutal struggle between rival factions competing for power and control. As Aiden uncovers the truth about his past and the experiments that shaped him, his own infection becomes both a curse and a weapon. Every decision reshapes the city, blurring the line between savior and destroyer in a world where survival often comes at the cost of morality.

The saga continues with DYING LIGHT: THE BEAST, returning to a darker and more personal chapter of the outbreak. The story explores the consequences of prolonged infection and experimentation, pushing the boundary between human and monster. As the virus evolves and the world grows even more hostile, survival is no longer just about staying alive — it is about resisting the loss of identity itself. The Beast represents the final stage of the Dying Light world: a future where the greatest threat is no longer the infected outside the walls, but what humanity may become in order to endure.

00:00 Gamer’s Little Playground Intro
00:12 Egg Cauldron
02:08 Egg Beatle
05:05 Dark Gaia Phoenix
09:21 Egg Devil Ray
12:08 Dark Moray
17:16 Dark Guardian

28:52 Egg Dragoon
36:53 Dark Gaia
49:10 Perfect Dark Gaia

Sonic is pursuing his nemesis, Doctor Eggman, bounding around a fleet of spaceships. Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and corners Eggman on a nearby space station. However, it is revealed to be a powerful new weapon known as the Chaos Energy Cannon, which not only traps and forcefully reverts Sonic to his normal state and extracts the Chaos Emeralds from him, but also drains them of their power, resulting in them becoming inert. Eggman then uses the Emeralds' energy to fire an enormous laser that unleashes an ancient evil known as Dark Gaia from the planet's core, which shatters its surface into seven pieces. In addition, the process has the unforeseen side-effect of transforming Sonic into a &quot;Werehog&quot;—a werewolf-like affliction that strips the hedgehog of his speed but bestows greater strength and abilities—during nighttime. Eggman ejects Sonic into space, who then lands safely onto the planet below.

After landing along with the Emeralds, Sonic encounters a friendly creature who appears to suffer from amnesia. Assuming he has caused it with his fall, Sonic decides to assist him in his quest to find out who he is and the creature becomes a guide for Sonic; he eventually gives him the nickname &quot;Chip&quot;. Sonic's quest begins and with the help of some old friends, such as Amy Rose and Tails, he attempts to solve the crisis by traveling the world's continents and finding Gaia Temples that will restore the Emeralds' power in order to return the world, and himself, back to normal.

🌟 DESCRIPTION🌟

The Evil Within 2 follows former detective Sebastian Castellanos as he is pulled back into the unstable world of STEM, a fractured simulation where reality is shaped by trauma, memory, and fear. Driven by the hope of reclaiming something he once lost, Sebastian must navigate a decaying town that constantly shifts between moments of calm exploration and sudden, overwhelming horror.

Gameplay blends survival horror and stealth, forcing players to manage limited resources, carefully aim weapons, and decide when to fight or avoid enemies altogether. The semi-open environments encourage exploration, offering upgrades, crafting materials, and side encounters that reward preparation and patience. Combat emphasizes tension over action, with enemies designed to punish reckless movement and poor positioning.

As the world becomes increasingly unstable, new threats and abilities emerge, pushing players to adapt their playstyle. Psychological horror, environmental storytelling, and player choice shape the experience, making survival as much about strategy and awareness as it is about confronting fear.

At its core, The Evil Within 2 is a survival horror journey that combines narrative-driven storytelling with deliberate, methodical gameplay, challenging players to endure a world where danger, uncertainty, and the mind itself are the greatest enemies.

   <media:description>BORDERLANDS: THE PRE-SEQUEL Full Gameplay Walkthrough / No Commentary【FULL GAME】4K 60FPS Ultra HD

🌟 DESCRIPTION🌟

The Pre-Sequel features four playable characters, each with a different class and abilities. All four of The Pre-Sequel's protagonists were non-player characters (NPCs) or bosses in previous Borderlands games.

Athena, &quot;the Gladiator&quot;, is a rogue assassin from the Atlas Corporation introduced in the Borderlands DLC campaign The Secret Armory of General Knoxx. As her primary skill, Athena can temporarily use a shield to absorb damage; her skill trees revolve around upgrading the shield, allowing it to be thrown at enemies, and absorb and reflect elemental damage, or towards melee attacks or elemental damage.

Sonic is pursuing his nemesis, Doctor Eggman, bounding around a fleet of spaceships. Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and corners Eggman on a nearby space station. However, it is revealed to be a powerful new weapon known as the Chaos Energy Cannon, which not only traps and forcefully reverts Sonic to his normal state and extracts the Chaos Emeralds from him, but also drains them of their power, resulting in them becoming inert. Eggman then uses the Emeralds' energy to fire an enormous laser that unleashes an ancient evil known as Dark Gaia from the planet's core, which shatters its surface into seven pieces. In addition, the process has the unforeseen side-effect of transforming Sonic into a &quot;Werehog&quot;—a werewolf-like affliction that strips the hedgehog of his speed but bestows greater strength and abilities—during nighttime. Eggman ejects Sonic into space, who then lands safely onto the planet below.

After landing along with the Emeralds, Sonic encounters a friendly creature who appears to suffer from amnesia. Assuming he has caused it with his fall, Sonic decides to assist him in his quest to find out who he is and the creature becomes a guide for Sonic; he eventually gives him the nickname &quot;Chip&quot;. Sonic's quest begins and with the help of some old friends, such as Amy Rose and Tails, he attempts to solve the crisis by traveling the world's continents and finding Gaia Temples that will restore the Emeralds' power in order to return the world, and himself, back to normal.
